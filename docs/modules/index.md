# Vercube Modules

Vercube is built with a modular architecture, allowing you to use only the components you need for your application. This section provides documentation for each module in the Vercube ecosystem.

## Core Modules

### [Core](./core/index.md)

The Core module is the foundation of the Vercube framework, providing essential functionality for building web applications.

### [DI (Dependency Injection)](./di/index.md)

The DI module provides a powerful dependency injection system for managing dependencies in your application.

### [Logger](./logger/index.md)

The Logger module provides a flexible and extensible logging system for your application.

## Module Architecture

Vercube modules follow these design principles:

1. **Modularity** - Each module is self-contained and can be used independently
2. **Dependency Injection** - Modules use the DI system for loose coupling
3. **Extensibility** - Modules can be extended with custom implementations
4. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
5. **Performance** - Optimized for high performance with minimal overhead
